The complexity comes from the need to simultaneously process hundreds of filters and channels in the high-dimensional convolutions, which involve a significant amount of data movement. Although highly-parallel compute paradigms, such as SIMD/SIMT, effectively address the computation requirement to achieve high throughput, energy consumption still remains high as data movement can be more expensive than computation. Accordingly, finding a dataflow that supports parallel processing with minimal data movement cost is crucial to achieving energy-efficient CNN processing without compromising accuracy. In this paper, we present a novel dataflow, called row-stationary (RS), that minimizes data movement energy consumption on a spatial architecture. This is realized by exploiting local data reuse of filter weights and feature map pixels, i.e., activations, in the high-dimensional convolutions, and minimizing data movement of partial sum accumulations. Unlike dataflows used in existing designs, which only reduce certain types of data movement, the proposed RS dataflow can adapt to different CNN shape configurations and reduces all types of data movement through maximally utilizing the processing engine (PE) local storage, direct inter-PE communication and spatial parallelism. To evaluate the energy efficiency of the different dataflows, we propose an analysis framework that compares energy cost under the same hardware area and processing parallelism constraints. Experiments using the CNN configurations of AlexNet show that the proposed RS dataflow is more energy efficient than existing dataflows in both convolutional (1.4\u00d7 to 2.5\u00d7) and fully-connected layers (at least 1.3\u00d7 for batch size larger than 16). The RS dataflow has also been demonstrated on a fabricated chip, which verifies our energy analysis.",

You are provided with the following abstract from a paper titled, \"Eyeriss: a spatial architecture for  energy-efficient dataflow for convolutional neural networks\":\n    \n    Abstract:  Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used in modern AI systems for their superior accuracy but at the cost of high computational complexity. The complexity comes from the need to simultaneously process hundreds of filters and channels in the high-dimensional convolutions, which involve a significant amount of data movement. Although highly-parallel compute paradigms, such as SIMD/SIMT, effectively address the computation requirement to achieve high throughput, energy consumption still remains high as data movement can be more expensive than computation. Accordingly, finding a dataflow that supports parallel processing with minimal data movement cost is crucial to achieving energy-efficient CNN processing without compromising accuracy. In this paper, we present a novel dataflow, called row-stationary (RS), that minimizes data movement energy consumption on a spatial architecture. This is realized by exploiting local data reuse of filter weights and feature map pixels, i.e., activations, in the high-dimensional convolutions, and minimizing data movement of partial sum accumulations. Unlike dataflows used in existing designs, which only reduce certain types of data movement, the proposed RS dataflow can adapt to different CNN shape configurations and reduces all types of data movement through maximally utilizing the processing engine (PE) local storage, direct inter-PE communication and spatial parallelism. To evaluate the energy efficiency of the different dataflows, we propose an analysis framework that compares energy cost under the same hardware area and processing parallelism constraints. Experiments using the CNN configurations of AlexNet show that the proposed RS dataflow is more energy efficient than existing dataflows in both convolutional (1.4\u00d7 to 2.5\u00d7) and fully-connected layers (at least 1.3\u00d7 for batch size larger than 16). The RS dataflow has also been demonstrated on a fabricated chip, which verifies our energy analysis.\n    \n    You have been asked to create 5 relevant question-answer pairs from this abstract for a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to understand computer architecture text and domain knowledge.

We demonstrate that despite the relatively small amount of DRAM, GraFBoost achieves high performance with very large graphs no other system can handle, and rivals the performance of the fastest software platforms on sizes of graphs that existing platforms can handle. Unlike in-memory and semi-external systems, GraFBoost uses a constant amount of memory for all problems, and its performance decreases very slowly as graph sizes increase, allowing GraFBoost to scale to much larger problems than possible with existing systems while using much less resources on a single-node system.

The sort-reduce accelerator logs random update requests and then uses hardware-accelerated external sorting with interleaved reduction functions.

We compare the performance of GraFBoost with 1 GB of DRAM against various state-of-the-art graph analytics software including FlashGraph, running on a 32-thread Xeon server with 128 GB of DRAM. We demonstrate that despite the relatively small amount of DRAM, GraFBoost achieves high performance with very large graphs no other system can handle, and rivals the performance of the fastest software platforms on sizes of graphs that existing platforms can handle. Unlike in-memory and semi-external systems, GraFBoost uses a constant amount of memory for all problems, and its performance decreases very slowly as graph sizes increase, allowing GraFBoost to scale to much larger problems than possible with existing systems while using much less resources on a single-node system. The key component of GraFBoost is the sort-reduce accelerator, which implements a novel method to sequentialize fine-grained random accesses to flash storage. The sort-reduce accelerator logs random update requests and then uses hardware-accelerated external sorting with interleaved reduction functions. GraFBoost also stores newly updated vertex values generated in each superstep of the algorithm lazily with the old vertex values to further reduce I/O traffic. We evaluate the performance of GraFBoost for PageRank, breadth-first search and betweenness centrality on our FPGA-based prototype (Xilinx VC707 with 1 GB DRAM and 1 TB flash) and compare it to other graph processing systems including a pure software implementation of GrapFBoost.\n    \n    You have been asked to create 5 relevant question-answer pairs from this abstract for a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to understand computer architecture text and domain knowledge.

Although speculative execution is essential for increasing the instructions per cycle (IPC), it does come at a cost. A large amount of unnecessary work results from wrong-path instructions entering the pipeline due to branch misprediction. Results generated with the SimpleScalar tool set using a 4-way issue pipeline and various branch predictors show an instruction overhead of 16% to 105% for event instruction committed. The instruction overhead will increase in the future as processors use more aggressive speculation and wider issue widths. In this paper we present an innovative method for power reduction ,which, unlike previous work that sacrificed flexibility or performance reduces power in high-performance microprocessors without impacting performance. In particular we introduce a hardware mechanism called pipeline gating to control rampant speculation in the pipeline. We present inexpensive mechanisms for determining when a branch is likely to mispredict, and for stopping wrong-path instructions from entering the pipeline. Results show up to a 38% reduction in wrong-path instructions with a negligible performance loss (/spl ap/1%).

In particular we introduce a hardware mechanism called pipeline gating to control rampant speculation in the pipeline. We present inexpensive mechanisms for determining when a branch is likely to mispredict, and for stopping wrong-path instructions from entering the pipeline. Results show up to a 38% reduction in wrong-path instructions with a negligible performance loss (/spl ap/1%). Best of all, even in programs with a high branch prediction accuracy, performance does not noticeable degrade. Our analysis indicates that there is little risk in implementing this method in existing processors since it does not impact performance and can benefit energy reduction.\n    \n    You have been asked to create 5 relevant question-answer pairs from this abstract for a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to understand computer architecture text and domain knowledge. You must generate 5 questions and they must follow the following templates: \n    #1) \"Does X provide Y benefits over Z?\" \n    #2) \"Is X primarily responsible for Y?\"\n    #3) \u201cIs X a Y?\u201d\n    #4) \"In X process, must Y always occur before Z?\"\n    #5) \"Does increasing X lead to Y?\"\n    \n    The questions should *not* be so tied to the paper's details or implementation but rather broad enough to be a useful benchmark to evaluate an LLMs computer architecture expertise.

Ongoing innovations in disk subsystems, along with the ever increasing gap between processor and memory speeds, have elevated memory system design as the critical performance factor for such workloads. However, most current server designs have been optimized to perform well on scientific and engineering workloads, potentially leading to design decisions that are non-ideal for commercial applications. The above problem is exacerbated by the lack of information on the performance requirements of commercial workloads, the lack of available applications for widespread study, and the fact that most representative applications are too large and complex to serve as suitable benchmarks for evaluating trade-offs in the design of processors and servers.This paper presents a detailed performance study of three important classes of commercial workloads: online transaction processing (OLTP), decision support systems (DSS), and Web index search. We use the Oracle commercial database engine for our OLTP and DSS workloads, and the AltaVista search engine for our Web index search workload. This study characterizes the memory system behavior of these workloads through a large number of architectural experiments on Alpha multiprocessors augmented with full system simulations to determine the impact of architectural trends. We also identify a set of simplifications that make these workloads more amenable to monitoring and simulation without affecting representative memory system behavior. We observe that systems optimized for OLTP versus DSS and index search workloads may lead to diverging designs, specifically in the size and speed requirements for off-chip caches.\n    \n    You have been asked to create 5 relevant question-answer pairs from this abstract for a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to understand computer architecture text and domain knowledge.

Among our contributions, we present a methodology that given an accelerator design, derives Pareto-optimal ASIC Cloud Servers, by extracting data from place-and-routed circuits and computational fluid dynamic simulations, and then employing clever but brute-force search to find the best jointly-optimized ASIC, DRAM subsystem, motherboard, power delivery system, cooling system, operating voltage, and case design. Moreover, we show how data center parameters determine which of the many Pareto-optimal points is TCO-optimal.

Among our contributions, we present a methodology that given an accelerator design, derives Pareto-optimal ASIC Cloud Servers, by extracting data from place-and-routed circuits and computational fluid dynamic simulations, and then employing clever but brute-force search to find the best jointly-optimized ASIC, DRAM subsystem, motherboard, power delivery system, cooling system, operating voltage, and case design. Moreover, we show how data center parameters determine which of the many Pareto-optimal points is TCO-optimal. Finally we examine when it makes sense to build an ASIC Cloud, and examine the impact of ASIC NRE.\n    \n    You have been asked to create 5 relevant question-answer pairs from this abstract for a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to understand computer architecture text and domain knowledge. You must generate 5 questions and they must follow the following templates: \n    #1) \"Does X provide Y benefits over Z?\" \n    #2) \"Is X primarily responsible for Y?\"\n    #3) \u201cIs X a Y?\u201d\n    #4) \"In X process, must Y always occur before Z?\"\n    #5) \"Does increasing X lead to Y?\"\n    \n    The questions should *not* be so tied to the paper's details or implementation but rather broad enough to be a useful benchmark to evaluate an LLMs computer architecture expertise.

You are provided with the following abstract from a paper titled, \"Eyeriss: a spatial architecture for  energy-efficient dataflow for convolutional neural networks\":\n    \n    Abstract:  Three-dimensional integration enables stacking memory directly on top of a microprocessor, thereby significantly reducing wire delay between the two. Previous studies have examined the performance benefits of such an approach, but all of these works only consider commodity 2D DRAM organizations. In this work, we explore more aggressive 3D DRAM organizations that make better use of the additional die-to-die bandwidth provided by 3D stacking, as well as the additional transistor count. Our simulation results show that with a few simple changes to the 3D-DRAM organization, we can achieve a 1.75x speedup over previously proposed 3D-DRAM approaches on our memory-intensive multi-programmed workloads on a quad-core processor. The significant increase in memory system performance makes the L2 miss handling architecture (MHA) a new bottleneck, which we address by combining a novel data structure called the Vector Bloom Filter with dynamic MSHR capacity tuning. Our scalable L2 MHA yields an additional 17.8% performance improvement over our 3D-stacked memory architecture.\n    \n    You have been asked to create 5 relevant question-answer pairs from this abstract for a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to understand computer architecture text and domain knowledge.

Specifically, we evaluate the applicability of active and idle low-power modes to reduce the power consumed by the primary server components (processor, memory, and disk), while maintaining tight response time constraints, particularly on 95th-percentile latency. Using Web search as a representative example of this workload class, we first characterize a production Web search workload at cluster-wide scale. We provide a fine-grain characterization and expose the opportunity for power savings using low-power modes of each primary server component. Second, we develop and validate a performance model to evaluate the impact of processor- and memory-based low-power modes on the search latency distribution and consider the benefit of current and foreseeable low-power modes. Our results highlight the challenges of power management for this class of workloads. In contrast to other server workloads, for which idle low-power modes have shown great promise, for OLDI workloads we find that energy-proportionality with acceptable query latency can only be achieved using coordinated, full-system active low-power modes.\n    \n    You have been asked to create 5 relevant question-answer pairs from this abstract for a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to understand computer architecture text and domain knowledge.

You are provided with the following abstract from a paper titled, \"Eyeriss: a spatial architecture for  energy-efficient dataflow for convolutional neural networks\":\n    \n    Abstract:  In recent years, neural network accelerators have been shown to achieve both high energy efficiency and high performance for a broad application scope within the important category of recognition and mining applications. Still, both the energy efficiency and performance of such accelerators remain limited by memory accesses. In this paper, we focus on image applications, arguably the most important category among recognition and mining applications. The neural networks which are state-of-the-art for these applications are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and they have an important property: weights are shared among many neurons, considerably reducing the neural network memory footprint. This property allows to entirely map a CNN within an SRAM, eliminating all DRAM accesses for weights. By further hoisting this accelerator next to the image sensor, it is possible to eliminate all remaining DRAM accesses, i.e., for inputs and outputs. In this paper, we propose such a CNN accelerator, placed next to a CMOS or CCD sensor. The absence of DRAM accesses combined with a careful exploitation of the specific data access patterns within CNNs allows us to design an accelerator which is 60&times more energy efficient than the previous state-of-the-art neural network accelerator.

To aid such understanding, this paper presents a detailed microarchitectural analysis of live datacenter jobs, measured on more than 20,000 Google machines over a three year period, and comprising thousands of different applications. We first find that WSC workloads are extremely diverse, breeding the need for architectures that can tolerate application variability without performance loss. However, some patterns emerge, offering opportunities for co-optimization of hardware and software. For example, we identify common building blocks in the lower levels of the software stack. This \"datacenter tax\" can comprise nearly 30% of cycles across jobs running in the fleet, which makes its constituents prime candidates for hardware specialization in future server systems-on-chips. We also uncover opportunities for classic microarchitectural optimizations for server processors, especially in the cache hierarchy.

You must generate 5 questions and they must follow the following templates: \n    #1) \"Does X provide Y benefits over Z?\" \n    #2) \"Is X primarily responsible for Y?\"\n    #3) \u201cIs X a Y?\u201d\n    #4) \"In X process, must Y always occur before Z?\"\n    #5) \"Does increasing X lead to Y?\"\n    \n    The questions should *not* be so tied to the paper's details or implementation but rather broad enough to be a useful benchmark to evaluate an LLMs computer architecture expertise. The question must be able to be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". Ensure diversity when constructing the 5 questions, so that the correct answers to each question are not all \u201cyes\u201d or all \u201cno\u201d. *Ensure diversity when constructing the 5 questions, so that half of the correct answers to each question are \"yes\" and half are \"no\"*.

This paper models multicore scaling limits by combining device scaling, single-core scaling, and multicore scaling to measure the speedup potential for a set of parallel workloads for the next five technology generations. For device scaling, we use both the ITRS projections and a set of more conservative device scaling parameters. To model single-core scaling, we combine measurements from over 150 processors to derive Pareto-optimal frontiers for area/performance and power/performance. Finally, to model multicore scaling, we build a detailed performance model of upper-bound performance and lower-bound core power. The multicore designs we study include single-threaded CPU-like and massively threaded GPU-like multicore chip organizations with symmetric, asymmetric, dynamic, and composed topologies. The study shows that regardless of chip organization and topology, multicore scaling is power limited to a degree not widely appreciated by the computing community.

The failure of Dennard scaling, to which the shift to multicore parts is partially a response, may soon limit multicore scaling just as single-core scaling has been curtailed. This paper models multicore scaling limits by combining device scaling, single-core scaling, and multicore scaling to measure the speedup potential for a set of parallel workloads for the next five technology generations. For device scaling, we use both the ITRS projections and a set of more conservative device scaling parameters. To model single-core scaling, we combine measurements from over 150 processors to derive Pareto-optimal frontiers for area/performance and power/performance. Finally, to model multicore scaling, we build a detailed performance model of upper-bound performance and lower-bound core power. The multicore designs we study include single-threaded CPU-like and massively threaded GPU-like multicore chip organizations with symmetric, asymmetric, dynamic, and composed topologies. The study shows that regardless of chip organization and topology, multicore scaling is power limited to a degree not widely appreciated by the computing community.

High-radix networks, however, require longer cables than their low-radix counterparts. Because cables dominate network cost, the number of cables, and particularly the number of long, global cables should be minimized to realize an efficient network. In this paper, we introduce the dragonfly topology which uses a group of high-radix routers as a virtual router to increase the effective radix of the network. With this organization, each minimally routed packet traverses at most one global channel. By reducing global channels, a dragonfly reduces cost by 20% compared to a flattened butterfly and by 52% compared to a folded Clos network in configurations with \u2265 16K nodes.We also introduce two new variants of global adaptive routing that enable load-balanced routing in the dragonfly. Each router in a dragonfly must make an adaptive routing decision based on the state of a global channel connected to a different router. Because of the indirect nature of this routing decision, conventional adaptive routing algorithms give degraded performance. We introduce the use of selective virtual-channel discrimination and the use of credit round-trip latency to both sense and signal channel congestion.

You are provided with the following abstract from a paper titled, \"Eyeriss: a spatial architecture for  energy-efficient dataflow for convolutional neural networks\":\n    \n    Abstract:  DRAM cells store data in the form of charge on a capacitor. This charge leaks off over time, eventually causing data to be lost. To prevent this data loss from occurring, DRAM cells must be periodically refreshed. Unfortunately, DRAM refresh operations waste energy and also degrade system performance by interfering with memory requests. These problems are expected to worsen as DRAM density increases. The amount of time that a DRAM cell can safely retain data without being refreshed is called the cell's retention time. In current systems, all DRAM cells are refreshed at the rate required to guarantee the integrity of the cell with the shortest retention time, resulting in unnecessary refreshes for cells with longer retention times. Prior work has proposed to reduce unnecessary refreshes by exploiting differences in retention time among DRAM cells; however, such mechanisms require knowledge of each cell's retention time. In this paper, we present a comprehensive quantitative study of retention behavior in modern DRAMs. Using a temperature-controlled FPGA-based testing platform, we collect retention time information from 248 commodity DDR3 DRAM chips from five major DRAM vendors. We observe two significant phenomena: data pattern dependence, where the retention time of each DRAM cell is significantly affected by the data stored in other DRAM cells, and variable retention time, where the retention time of some DRAM cells changes unpredictably over time.

Each instantiation of the fabric consists of a 6x8 2-D torus of high-end Stratix V FPGAs embedded into a half-rack of 48 machines. One FPGA is placed into each server, accessible through PCIe, and wired directly to other FPGAs with pairs of 10 Gb SAS cables. In this paper, we describe a medium-scale deployment of this fabric on a bed of 1,632 servers, and measure its efficacy in accelerating the Bing web search engine. We describe the requirements and architecture of the system, detail the critical engineering challenges and solutions needed to make the system robust in the presence of failures, and measure the performance, power, and resilience of the system when ranking candidate documents. Under high load, the largescale reconfigurable fabric improves the ranking throughput of each server by a factor of 95% for a fixed latency distribution--- or, while maintaining equivalent throughput, reduces the tail latency by 29%.",

You are provided with the following abstract from a paper titled, \"Eyeriss: a spatial architecture for  energy-efficient dataflow for convolutional neural networks\":\n    \n    Abstract:  Datacenter workloads demand high computational capabilities, flexibility, power efficiency, and low cost. It is challenging to improve all of these factors simultaneously. To advance datacenter capabilities beyond what commodity server designs can provide, we have designed and built a composable, reconfigurablefabric to accelerate portions of large-scale software services. Each instantiation of the fabric consists of a 6x8 2-D torus of high-end Stratix V FPGAs embedded into a half-rack of 48 machines. One FPGA is placed into each server, accessible through PCIe, and wired directly to other FPGAs with pairs of 10 Gb SAS cables. In this paper, we describe a medium-scale deployment of this fabric on a bed of 1,632 servers, and measure its efficacy in accelerating the Bing web search engine. We describe the requirements and architecture of the system, detail the critical engineering challenges and solutions needed to make the system robust in the presence of failures, and measure the performance, power, and resilience of the system when ranking candidate documents. Under high load, the largescale reconfigurable fabric improves the ranking throughput of each server by a factor of 95% for a fixed latency distribution--- or, while maintaining equivalent throughput, reduces the tail latency by 29%.\n    \n    You have been asked to create 5 relevant question-answer pairs from this abstract for a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to understand computer architecture text and domain knowledge.

Such applications usually have a working-set larger than the cache or have frequent bursts of references to non-temporal data (called scans). To improve the performance of such workloads, this paper proposes cache replacement using Re-reference Interval Prediction (RRIP). We propose Static RRIP (SRRIP) that is scan-resistant and Dynamic RRIP (DRRIP) that is both scan-resistant and thrash-resistant. Both RRIP policies require only 2-bits per cache block and easily integrate into existing LRU approximations found in modern processors. Our evaluations using PC games, multimedia, server and SPEC CPU2006 workloads on a single-core processor with a 2MB last-level cache (LLC) show that both SRRIP and DRRIP outperform LRU replacement on the throughput metric by an average of 4% and 10% respectively. Our evaluations with over 1000 multi-programmed workloads on a 4-core CMP with an 8MB shared LLC show that SRRIP and DRRIP outperform LRU replacement on the throughput metric by an average of 7% and 9% respectively.

You are provided with the following abstract from a paper titled, \"Eyeriss: a spatial architecture for  energy-efficient dataflow for convolutional neural networks\":\n    \n    Abstract:  Practical cache replacement policies attempt to emulate optimal replacement by predicting the re-reference interval of a cache block. The commonly used LRU replacement policy always predicts a near-immediate re-reference interval on cache hits and misses. Applications that exhibit a distant re-reference interval perform badly under LRU. Such applications usually have a working-set larger than the cache or have frequent bursts of references to non-temporal data (called scans). To improve the performance of such workloads, this paper proposes cache replacement using Re-reference Interval Prediction (RRIP). We propose Static RRIP (SRRIP) that is scan-resistant and Dynamic RRIP (DRRIP) that is both scan-resistant and thrash-resistant. Both RRIP policies require only 2-bits per cache block and easily integrate into existing LRU approximations found in modern processors. Our evaluations using PC games, multimedia, server and SPEC CPU2006 workloads on a single-core processor with a 2MB last-level cache (LLC) show that both SRRIP and DRRIP outperform LRU replacement on the throughput metric by an average of 4% and 10% respectively. Our evaluations with over 1000 multi-programmed workloads on a 4-core CMP with an 8MB shared LLC show that SRRIP and DRRIP outperform LRU replacement on the throughput metric by an average of 7% and 9% respectively. We also show that RRIP outperforms LFU, the state-of the art scan-resistant replacement algorithm to-date. For the cache configurations under study, RRIP requires 2X less hardware than LRU and 2.5X less hardware than LFU.\n    \n    You have been asked to create 5 relevant question-answer pairs from this abstract for a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to understand computer architecture text and domain knowledge.

Emerging applications (e.g., data serving and web search) that run in these datacenters operate on vast datasets that are not accommodated by on-die caches of existing server chips. Large caches reduce the die area available for cores and lower performance through long access latency when instructions are fetched. Performance on scale-out workloads is maximized through a modestly-sized last-level cache that captures the instruction footprint at the lowest possible access latency. In this work, we introduce a methodology for designing scalable and efficient scale-out server processors.

Each pod is a complete server that tightly couples a number of cores to a small last-level cache using a fast interconnect. Replicating the pod to fill the die area yields processors which have optimal performance density, leading to maximum per-chip throughput.

You are provided with the following abstract from a paper titled, \"Eyeriss: a spatial architecture for  energy-efficient dataflow for convolutional neural networks\":\n    \n    Abstract:  Scale-out datacenters mandate high per-server throughput to get the maximum benefit from the large TCO investment. Emerging applications (e.g., data serving and web search) that run in these datacenters operate on vast datasets that are not accommodated by on-die caches of existing server chips. Large caches reduce the die area available for cores and lower performance through long access latency when instructions are fetched. Performance on scale-out workloads is maximized through a modestly-sized last-level cache that captures the instruction footprint at the lowest possible access latency. In this work, we introduce a methodology for designing scalable and efficient scale-out server processors. Based on a metric of performance-density, we facilitate the design of optimal multi-core configurations, called pods. Each pod is a complete server that tightly couples a number of cores to a small last-level cache using a fast interconnect. Replicating the pod to fill the die area yields processors which have optimal performance density, leading to maximum per-chip throughput. Moreover, as each pod is a stand-alone server, scale-out processors avoid the expense of global (i.e., inter-pod) interconnect and coherence. These features synergistically maximize throughput, lower design complexity, and improve technology scalability.

Recent work relies on static profiling to precisely predict the QoS degradation that results from performance interference among co-running applications to increase the number of \"safe\" co-locations. However, these static profiling techniques have several critical limitations: 1) a priori knowledge of all workloads is required for profiling, 2) it is difficult for the prediction to capture or adapt to phase or load changes of applications, and 3) the prediction technique is limited to only two co-running applications. To address all of these limitations, we present Bubble-Flux, an integrated dynamic interference measurement and online QoS management mechanism to provide accurate QoS control and maximize server utilization. Bubble-Flux uses a Dynamic Bubble to probe servers in real time to measure the instantaneous pressure on the shared hardware resources and precisely predict how the QoS of a latency-sensitive job will be affected by potential co-runners. Once \"safe\" batch jobs are selected and mapped to a server, Bubble-Flux uses an Online Flux Engine to continuously monitor the QoS of the latency-sensitive application and control the execution of batch jobs to adapt to dynamic input, phase, and load changes to deliver satisfactory QoS. Batch applications remain in a state of flux throughout execution. Our results show that the utilization improvement achieved by Bubble-Flux is up to 2.2x better than the prior static approach.",

Recent work relies on static profiling to precisely predict the QoS degradation that results from performance interference among co-running applications to increase the number of \"safe\" co-locations. However, these static profiling techniques have several critical limitations: 1) a priori knowledge of all workloads is required for profiling, 2) it is difficult for the prediction to capture or adapt to phase or load changes of applications, and 3) the prediction technique is limited to only two co-running applications. To address all of these limitations, we present Bubble-Flux, an integrated dynamic interference measurement and online QoS management mechanism to provide accurate QoS control and maximize server utilization. Bubble-Flux uses a Dynamic Bubble to probe servers in real time to measure the instantaneous pressure on the shared hardware resources and precisely predict how the QoS of a latency-sensitive job will be affected by potential co-runners. Once \"safe\" batch jobs are selected and mapped to a server, Bubble-Flux uses an Online Flux Engine to continuously monitor the QoS of the latency-sensitive application and control the execution of batch jobs to adapt to dynamic input, phase, and load changes to deliver satisfactory QoS.

We further demonstrate that Accel-Sim is able to simulate benchmark suites that no other open-source simulator can. In particular, we use Accel-sim to simulate an additional 60 workloads, comprised of 11,440 kernel instances, from the machine learning benchmark suite Deepbench. Deepbench makes use of closed-source, hand-tuned kernels with no virtual ISA implementation. Using a rigorous counter-by-counter analysis, we validate Accel-Sim against contemporary GPUs.Finally, to highlight the effects of falling behind industry, this paper presents two case-studies that demonstrate how incorrect baseline assumptions can hide new areas of opportunity and lead to potentially incorrect design decisions.",

In particular, we use Accel-sim to simulate an additional 60 workloads, comprised of 11,440 kernel instances, from the machine learning benchmark suite Deepbench. Deepbench makes use of closed-source, hand-tuned kernels with no virtual ISA implementation. Using a rigorous counter-by-counter analysis, we validate Accel-Sim against contemporary GPUs.Finally, to highlight the effects of falling behind industry, this paper presents two case-studies that demonstrate how incorrect baseline assumptions can hide new areas of opportunity and lead to potentially incorrect design decisions.\n    \n    You have been asked to create 5 relevant question-answer pairs from this abstract for a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to understand computer architecture text and domain knowledge.

A comprehensive set of microbenchmarks and automated correlation plotting ease the modeling process.We use these three new mechanisms to build Accel-Sim, a detailed simulation framework that decreases cycle error 79 percentage points, over a wide range of 80 workloads, consisting of 1,945 kernel instances. We further demonstrate that Accel-Sim is able to simulate benchmark suites that no other open-source simulator can. In particular, we use Accel-sim to simulate an additional 60 workloads, comprised of 11,440 kernel instances, from the machine learning benchmark suite Deepbench. Deepbench makes use of closed-source, hand-tuned kernels with no virtual ISA implementation. Using a rigorous counter-by-counter analysis, we validate Accel-Sim against contemporary GPUs.Finally, to highlight the effects of falling behind industry, this paper presents two case-studies that demonstrate how incorrect baseline assumptions can hide new areas of opportunity and lead to potentially incorrect design decisions.\n    \n    You have been asked to create 5 relevant question-answer pairs from this abstract for a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to understand computer architecture text and domain knowledge.

Due to its bio-compatibility and ease of engineering, one promising approach for performing in-vivo computation is DNA strand displacement. This paper introduces computer architects to DNA strand displacement \"circuits\", discusses associated architectural challenges, and proposes a new organization that provides practical composability. In particular, prior approaches rely mostly on stochastic interaction of freely diffusing components. This paper proposes practical spatial isolation of components, leading to more easily designed DNA-based circuits. DNA nanotechnology is currently at a turning point, with many proposed applications being realized [20, 9].

In particular, large-scale graph processing is gaining attention due to its broad applicability from social science to machine learning. However, scalable hardware design that can efficiently process large graphs in main memory is still an open problem. Ideally, cost-effective and scalable graph processing systems can be realized by building a system whose performance increases proportionally with the sizes of graphs that can be stored in the system, which is extremely challenging in conventional systems due to severe memory bandwidth limitations. In this work, we argue that the conventional concept of processing-in-memory (PIM) can be a viable solution to achieve such an objective.

You are provided with the following abstract from a paper titled, \"Eyeriss: a spatial architecture for  energy-efficient dataflow for convolutional neural networks\":\n    \n    Abstract:  The bandwidth and latency of a memory system are strongly dependent on the manner in which accesses interact with the \u201c3-D\u201d structure of banks, rows, and columns characteristic of contemporary DRAM chips. There is nearly an order of magnitude difference in bandwidth between successive references to different columns within a row and different rows within a bank. This paper introduces memory access scheduling, a technique that improves the performance of a memory system by reordering memory references to exploit locality within the 3-D memory structure. Conservative reordering, in which the first ready reference in a sequence is performed, improves bandwidth by 40% for traces from five media benchmarks. Aggressive reordering, in which operations are scheduled to optimize memory bandwidth, improves bandwidth by 93% for the same set of applications. Memory access scheduling is particularly important for media processors where it enables the processor to make the most efficient use of scarce memory bandwidth.\n    \n    You have been asked to create 5 relevant question-answer pairs from this abstract for a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to understand computer architecture text and domain knowledge.

As a result, it is crucial that power/performance tradeoffs be made more visible to chip architects and even compiler writers, in addition to circuit designers. Most existing power analysis tools achieve high accuracy by calculating power estimates for designs only after layout or floorplanning are complete.

This paper presents Wattch, a framework for analyzing and optimizing microprocessor power dissipation at the architecture-level.

This paper presents several validations of Wattch's accuracy. In addition, we present three examples that demonstrate how architects or compiler writers might use Wattch to evaluate power consumption in their design process. We see Wattch as a complement to existing lower-level tools; it allows architects to explore and cull the design space early on, using faster, higher-level tools.

This paper examines selective techniques for using value prediction in the presence of predictor capacity constraints and reasonable misprediction penalties. We examine prediction and confidence mechanisms in light of these constraints, and we minimize capacity conflicts through instruction filtering. The latter technique filters which instructions put values into the value prediction table. We examine filtering techniques based on instruction type, as well as giving priority to instructions belonging to the longest data dependence path in the processor's active instruction window. We apply filtering both to the producers of predicted values and the consumers. In addition, we examine the benefit of using different confidence levels for instructions using predicted values on the longest dependence path.",

This paper examines selective techniques for using value prediction in the presence of predictor capacity constraints and reasonable misprediction penalties. We examine prediction and confidence mechanisms in light of these constraints, and we minimize capacity conflicts through instruction filtering. The latter technique filters which instructions put values into the value prediction table. We examine filtering techniques based on instruction type, as well as giving priority to instructions belonging to the longest data dependence path in the processor's active instruction window. We apply filtering both to the producers of predicted values and the consumers. In addition, we examine the benefit of using different confidence levels for instructions using predicted values on the longest dependence path.\n    \n    You have been asked to create 5 relevant question-answer pairs from this abstract for a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to understand computer architecture text and domain knowledge.

You are provided with the following abstract from a paper titled, \"Eyeriss: a spatial architecture for  energy-efficient dataflow for convolutional neural networks\":\n    \n    Abstract:  Future computing workloads will emphasize an architecture's ability to perform relatively simple calculations on massive quantities of mixed-width data. This paper describes a novel reconfigurable fabric architecture, PipeRench, optimized to accelerate these types of computations. PipeRench enables fast, robust compilers, supports forward compatibility, and virtualizes configurations, thus removing the fixed size constraint present in other fabrics. For the first time we explore how the bit-width of processing elements affects performance and show how the PipeRench architecture has been optimized to balance the needs of the compiler against the realities of silicon. Finally, we demonstrate extreme performance speedup on certain computing kernels (up to 190x versus a modern RISC processor), and analyze how this acceleration translates to application speedup.\n    \n    You have been asked to create 5 relevant question-answer pairs from this abstract for a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to understand computer architecture text and domain knowledge.

We use detailed simulation of 12 benchmarks to study the effectiveness of current architectural features and identify future challenges for these workloads. Our results show that conventional techniques in current processors to enhance instruction-level parallelism (ILP) provide a factor of 2.3 X to 4.2 X performance improvement.

The remaining benchmarks require relatively large cache sizes (dependent on the display sizes) to exploit data reuse, but derive less than 1.2 X performance benefits with the larger caches.

You are provided with the following abstract from a paper titled, \"Eyeriss: a spatial architecture for  energy-efficient dataflow for convolutional neural networks\":\n    \n    Abstract:  In response to the growing gap between memory access time and processor speed, DRAM manufacturers have created several new DRAM architectures. This paper presents a simulation-based performance study of a representative group, each evaluated in a small system organization. These small-system organizations correspond to workstation-class computers and use on the order of 10 DRAM chips. The study covers Fast Page Mode, Extended Data Out, Synchronous, Enhanced Synchronous, Synchronous Link, Rambus, and Direct Rambus designs. Our simulations reveal several things: (a) current advanced DRAM technologies are attacking the memory bandwidth problem but not the latency problem; (b) bus transmission speed will soon become a primary factor limiting memory-system performance; (c) the post-L2 address stream still contains significant locality, though it varies from application to application; and (d) as we move to wider buses, row access time becomes more prominent, making it important to investigate techniques to exploit the available locality to decrease access time.\n    \n    You have been asked to create 5 relevant question-answer pairs from this abstract for a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to understand computer architecture text and domain knowledge. You must generate 5 questions and they must follow the following templates: \n    #1) \"Does X provide Y benefits over Z?\" \n    #2) \"Is X primarily responsible for Y?\"\n    #3) \u201cIs X a Y?\u201d\n    #4) \"In X process, must Y always occur before Z?\"\n    #5) \"Does increasing X lead to Y?\"\n    \n    The questions should *not* be so tied to the paper's details or implementation but rather broad enough to be a useful benchmark to evaluate an LLMs computer architecture expertise. The question must be able to be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\".

But our approach provides the ability to replay an application's execution across context switches and interrupts. Hence, BugNet obviates the need for tracking program I/O, interrupts and DMA transfers, which would have otherwise required more complex hardware support. In addition, BugNet does not require a final core dump of the system state for replaying, which significantly reduces the amount of data that must be sent back to the developer.\n    \n    You have been asked to create 5 relevant question-answer pairs from this abstract for a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to understand computer architecture text and domain knowledge.

This resulted in the use of three fetch-block old compressed branch history information for accesing the predictor. Implementation constraints also restricted the composition of the index functions for the predictor and forced the usage of only single-ported memory cells.Nevertheless, we show that the Alpha EV8 branch predictor achieves prediction accuracy in the same range as the state-of-the-art academic global history branch predictors that do not consider implementation constraints in great detail.\n    \n    You have been asked to create 5 relevant question-answer pairs from this abstract for a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to understand computer architecture text and domain knowledge.

The effectiveness at improving performance stems from using a dependence-graph model of the microarchitectural critical path that identifies execution bottlenecks by incorporating both data and machine-specific dependences. The simplicity stems from a token-passing algorithm that computes the critical path without actually building the dependence graph. By focusing processor policies on critical instructions, our predictor enables a large class of optimizations. It can (i) give priority to critical instructions for scarce resources (functional units, ports, predictor entries); and (ii) suppress speculation on non-critical instructions, thus reducing \u201cuseless\u201d misspeculations. We present two case studies that illustrate the potential of the two types of optimization, we show that (i) critical-path-based dynamic instruction scheduling and steering in a clustered architecture improves performance by as much as 21% (10% on average); and (ii) focusing value prediction only on critical instructions improves performance by as much as 5%, due to removing nearly half of the misspeculations.\n    \n    You have been asked to create 5 relevant question-answer pairs from this abstract for a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to understand computer architecture text and domain knowledge.

You must generate 5 questions and they must follow the following templates: \n    #1) \"Does X provide Y benefits over Z?\" \n    #2) \"Is X primarily responsible for Y?\"\n    #3) \u201cIs X a Y?\u201d\n    #4) \"In X process, must Y always occur before Z?\"\n    #5) \"Does increasing X lead to Y?\"\n    \n    The questions should *not* be so tied to the paper's details or implementation but rather broad enough to be a useful benchmark to evaluate an LLMs computer architecture expertise.

The L2 slices can be managed using two basic schemes: 1) each slice is treated as a private L2 cache for the tile; 2) all slices are treated as a single large L2 cache shared by all tiles. Private L2 caches provide the lowest hit latency but reduce the total effective cache capacity, as each tile creates local copies of any line it touches. A shared L2 cache increases the effective cache capacity for shared data, but incurs long hit latencies when L2 data is on a remote tile. We present a new cache management policy, victim replication, which combines the advantages of private and shared schemes. Victim replication is a variant of the shared scheme which attempts to keep copies of local primary cache victims within the local L2 cache slice. Hits to these replicated copies reduce the effective latency of the shared L2 cache, while retaining the benefits of a higher effective capacity for shared data. We evaluate the various schemes using full-system simulation of both single-threaded and multi-threaded benchmarks running on an 8-processor tiled CMP. We show that victim replication reduces the average memory access latency of the shared L2 cache by an average of 16% for multi-threaded benchmarks and 24% for single-threaded benchmarks, providing better overall performance than either private or shared schemes.",

Hits to these replicated copies reduce the effective latency of the shared L2 cache, while retaining the benefits of a higher effective capacity for shared data. We evaluate the various schemes using full-system simulation of both single-threaded and multi-threaded benchmarks running on an 8-processor tiled CMP. We show that victim replication reduces the average memory access latency of the shared L2 cache by an average of 16% for multi-threaded benchmarks and 24% for single-threaded benchmarks, providing better overall performance than either private or shared schemes.\n    \n    You have been asked to create 5 relevant question-answer pairs from this abstract for a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to understand computer architecture text and domain knowledge.

Although large caches can significantly improve performance, they have the potential to increase power consumption. As feature sizes shrink, the dominant component of this power loss will be leakage.

CRTR extends the previously-proposed CRT for transient-fault detection in CMPs, and the previously-proposed SRTR for transient-fault recovery in SMT. All these schemes achieve fault tolerance by executing and comparing two copies, called leading and trailing threads, of a given application. Previous recovery schemes for SMT do not perform well on CMPs. In a CMP, the leading and trailing threads execute on different processors to achieve load balancing and reduce the probability of a fault corrupting both threads; whereas in an SMT, both threads execute on the same processor. The inter-processor communication required to compare the threads introduces latency and bandwidth problems not present in an SMT.To hide inter-processor latency, CRTR executes the leading thread ahead of the trailing thread by maintaining a long slack, enabled by asymmetric commit. CRTR commits the leading thread before checking and the trailing thread after checking, so that the trailing thread state may be used for recovery. Previous recovery schemes commit both threads after checking, making a long slack suboptimal. To tackle inter-processor bandwidth, CRTR not only increases the bandwidth supply by pipelining the communication paths, but also reduces the bandwidth demand. By reasoning that faults propagate through dependences, previously-proposed Dependence-Based Checking Elision (DBCE) exploits (true) register dependence chains so that only the value of the last instruction in a chain is checked. However, instructions that mask operand bits may mask faults and limit the use of dependence chains. We propose Death- and Dependence-Based Checking Elision (DDBCE), which chains a masking instruction only if the source operand of the instruction dies after the instruction. Register deaths ensure that masked faults do not corrupt later computation. Using SPEC2000, we show that CRTR incurs negligible performance loss compared to CRT for inter-processor (one-way) latency as high as 30 cycles, and that the bandwidth requirements of CRT and CRTR with DDBCE are 5.2 and 7.1 bytes/cycle, respectively.",

You are provided with the following abstract from a paper titled, \"Eyeriss: a spatial architecture for  energy-efficient dataflow for convolutional neural networks\":\n    \n    Abstract:  To address the increasing susceptibility of commodity chip multiprocessors (CMPs) to transient faults, we propose Chiplevel Redundantly Threaded multiprocessor with Recovery (CRTR). CRTR extends the previously-proposed CRT for transient-fault detection in CMPs, and the previously-proposed SRTR for transient-fault recovery in SMT. All these schemes achieve fault tolerance by executing and comparing two copies, called leading and trailing threads, of a given application. Previous recovery schemes for SMT do not perform well on CMPs. In a CMP, the leading and trailing threads execute on different processors to achieve load balancing and reduce the probability of a fault corrupting both threads; whereas in an SMT, both threads execute on the same processor. The inter-processor communication required to compare the threads introduces latency and bandwidth problems not present in an SMT.To hide inter-processor latency, CRTR executes the leading thread ahead of the trailing thread by maintaining a long slack, enabled by asymmetric commit. CRTR commits the leading thread before checking and the trailing thread after checking, so that the trailing thread state may be used for recovery. Previous recovery schemes commit both threads after checking, making a long slack suboptimal. To tackle inter-processor bandwidth, CRTR not only increases the bandwidth supply by pipelining the communication paths, but also reduces the bandwidth demand. By reasoning that faults propagate through dependences, previously-proposed Dependence-Based Checking Elision (DBCE) exploits (true) register dependence chains so that only the value of the last instruction in a chain is checked. However, instructions that mask operand bits may mask faults and limit the use of dependence chains. We propose Death- and Dependence-Based Checking Elision (DDBCE), which chains a masking instruction only if the source operand of the instruction dies after the instruction. Register deaths ensure that masked faults do not corrupt later computation. Using SPEC2000, we show that CRTR incurs negligible performance loss compared to CRT for inter-processor (one-way) latency as high as 30 cycles, and that the bandwidth requirements of CRT and CRTR with DDBCE are 5.2 and 7.1 bytes/cycle, respectively.\n    \n    You have been asked to create 5 relevant question-answer pairs from this abstract for a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to understand computer architecture text and domain knowledge.

You are provided with the following abstract from a paper titled, \"Eyeriss: a spatial architecture for  energy-efficient dataflow for convolutional neural networks\":\n    \n    Abstract:  This paper describes the polymorphous TRIPS architecture which can be configured for different granularities and types of parallelism. TRIPS contains mechanisms that enable the processing cores and the on-chip memory system to be configured and combined in different modes for instruction, data, or thread-level parallelism. To adapt to small and large-grain concurrency, the TRIPS architecture contains four out-of-order, 16-wide-issue Grid Processor cores, which can be partitioned when easily extractable fine-grained parallelism exists. This approach to polymorphism provides better performance across a wide range of application types than an approach in which many small processors are aggregated to run workloads with irregular parallelism. Our results show that high performance can be obtained in each of the three modes--ILP, TLP, and DLP-demonstrating the viability of the polymorphous coarse-grained approach for future microprocessors.\n    \n    You have been asked to create 5 relevant question-answer pairs from this abstract for a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to understand computer architecture text and domain knowledge.

This paper examines methods for reducing leakage power within the cache memories of the CPU. Because caches comprise much of a CPU chip's area and transistor counts, they are reasonable targets for attacking leakage. We discuss policies and implementations for reducing cache leakage by invalidating and \"turning off\" cache lines when they hold data not likely to be reused. In particular our approach is targeted at the generational nature of cache line usage. That is, cache lines typically have a flurry of frequent use when first brought into the cache, and then have a period of \"dead time\" before they are evicted. By devising effective, low-power ways of deducing dead time, our results show that in many cases we can reduce Ll cache leakage energy by 4/spl times/ in SPEC2000 applications without impacting performance. Because our decay-based techniques have notions of competitive on-line algorithms at their roots, their energy usage can be theoretically bounded at within a factor of two of the optimal oracle-based policy. We also examine adaptive decay-based policies that make energy-minimizing policy choices on a per-application basis by choosing appropriate decay intervals individually, for each cache line.

You are provided with the following abstract from a paper titled, \"Eyeriss: a spatial architecture for  energy-efficient dataflow for convolutional neural networks\":\n    \n    Abstract:  Power dissipation is increasingly important in CPUs ranging from those intended for mobile use, all the way up to high performance processors for high-end servers. While the bulk of the power dissipated is dynamic switching power leakage power is also beginning to be a concern. Chipmakers expect that in future chip generations, leakage's proportion of total chip power will increase significantly. This paper examines methods for reducing leakage power within the cache memories of the CPU. Because caches comprise much of a CPU chip's area and transistor counts, they are reasonable targets for attacking leakage. We discuss policies and implementations for reducing cache leakage by invalidating and \"turning off\" cache lines when they hold data not likely to be reused. In particular our approach is targeted at the generational nature of cache line usage. That is, cache lines typically have a flurry of frequent use when first brought into the cache, and then have a period of \"dead time\" before they are evicted. By devising effective, low-power ways of deducing dead time, our results show that in many cases we can reduce Ll cache leakage energy by 4/spl times/ in SPEC2000 applications without impacting performance. Because our decay-based techniques have notions of competitive on-line algorithms at their roots, their energy usage can be theoretically bounded at within a factor of two of the optimal oracle-based policy. We also examine adaptive decay-based policies that make energy-minimizing policy choices on a per-application basis by choosing appropriate decay intervals individually, for each cache line. Our proposed adaptive policies effectively reduce Ll cache leakage energy by 5/spl times/ for the SPEC2000 with only negligible degradations in performance.\n    \n    You have been asked to create 5 relevant question-answer pairs from this abstract for a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to understand computer architecture text and domain knowledge.

Unfortunately, current error correction techniques are poorly suited to this emerging class of memory technologies.

ECP corrects errors by permanently encoding the locations of failed cells into a table and assigning cells to replace them.

You must generate 5 questions and they must follow the following templates: \n    #1) \"Does X provide Y benefits over Z?\" \n    #2) \"Is X primarily responsible for Y?\"\n    #3) \u201cIs X a Y?\u201d\n    #4) \"In X process, must Y always occur before Z?\"\n    #5) \"Does increasing X lead to Y?\"\n    \n    The questions should *not* be so tied to the paper's details or implementation but rather broad enough to be a useful benchmark to evaluate an LLMs computer architecture expertise. The question must be able to be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". Ensure diversity when constructing the 5 questions, so that the correct answers to each question are not all \u201cyes\u201d or all \u201cno\u201d. *Ensure diversity when constructing the 5 questions, so that half of the correct answers to each question are \"yes\" and half are \"no\"*.

Their wider adoption rests, however, on achieving adequate real-time performance, meeting stringent power constraints, and adhering to FDA-mandated safety requirements for chronic implantation. BCIs have, to date, been designed as custom ASICs for specific diseases or for specific tasks in specific brain regions. General-purpose architectures that can be used to treat multiple diseases and enable various computational tasks are needed for wider BCI adoption, but the conventional wisdom is that such systems cannot meet necessary performance and power constraints. We present HALO (Hardware Architecture for LOw-power BCIs), a general-purpose architecture for implantable BCIs. HALO enables tasks such as treatment of disorders (e.g., epilepsy, movement disorders), and records/processes data for studies that advance our understanding of the brain. We use electrophysiological data from the motor cortex of a non-human primate to determine how to decompose HALO's computational capabilities into hardware building blocks. We simplify, prune, and share these building blocks to judiciously use available hardware resources while enabling many modes of brain-computer interaction. The result is a configurable heterogeneous array of hardware processing elements (PEs). The PEs are configured by a low-power RISC-V micro-controller into signal processing pipelines that meet the target performance and power constraints necessary to deploy HALO widely and safely.",

You are provided with the following abstract from a paper titled, \"Eyeriss: a spatial architecture for  energy-efficient dataflow for convolutional neural networks\":\n    \n    Abstract:  Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer avenues to treat neurological disorders, shed light on brain function, and interface the brain with the digital world. Their wider adoption rests, however, on achieving adequate real-time performance, meeting stringent power constraints, and adhering to FDA-mandated safety requirements for chronic implantation. BCIs have, to date, been designed as custom ASICs for specific diseases or for specific tasks in specific brain regions. General-purpose architectures that can be used to treat multiple diseases and enable various computational tasks are needed for wider BCI adoption, but the conventional wisdom is that such systems cannot meet necessary performance and power constraints. We present HALO (Hardware Architecture for LOw-power BCIs), a general-purpose architecture for implantable BCIs. HALO enables tasks such as treatment of disorders (e.g., epilepsy, movement disorders), and records/processes data for studies that advance our understanding of the brain. We use electrophysiological data from the motor cortex of a non-human primate to determine how to decompose HALO's computational capabilities into hardware building blocks. We simplify, prune, and share these building blocks to judiciously use available hardware resources while enabling many modes of brain-computer interaction. The result is a configurable heterogeneous array of hardware processing elements (PEs). The PEs are configured by a low-power RISC-V micro-controller into signal processing pipelines that meet the target performance and power constraints necessary to deploy HALO widely and safely.\n    \n    You have been asked to create 5 relevant question-answer pairs from this abstract for a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to understand computer architecture text and domain knowledge.

You are provided with the following abstract from a paper titled, \"Eyeriss: a spatial architecture for  energy-efficient dataflow for convolutional neural networks\":\n    \n    Abstract:  Machine-learning (ML) hardware and software system demand is burgeoning. Driven by ML applications, the number of different ML inference systems has exploded. Over 100 organizations are building ML inference chips, and the systems that incorporate existing models span at least three orders of magnitude in power consumption and five orders of magnitude in performance; they range from embedded devices to data-center solutions. Fueling the hardware are a dozen or more software frameworks and libraries. The myriad combinations of ML hardware and ML software make assessing ML-system performance in an architecture-neutral, representative, and reproducible manner challenging. There is a clear need for industry-wide standard ML benchmarking and evaluation criteria. MLPerf Inference answers that call. In this paper, we present our benchmarking method for evaluating ML inference systems. Driven by more than 30 organizations as well as more than 200 ML engineers and practitioners, MLPerf prescribes a set of rules and best practices to ensure comparability across systems with wildly differing architectures.

We then exploit the characteristics of modern plesiochronous links to adjust their power and performance envelopes dynamically. Using a network simulator, driven by both synthetic workloads and production datacenter traces, we characterize and understand design tradeoffs, and demonstrate an 85% reduction in power --- which approaches the ideal energy-proportionality of the network. Our results also demonstrate two challenges for the designers of future network switches: 1) We show that there is a significant power advantage to having independent control of each unidirectional channel comprising a network link, since many traffic patterns show very asymmetric use, and 2) system designers should work to optimize the high-speed channel designs to be more energy efficient by choosing optimal data rate and equalization technology. Given these assumptions, we demonstrate that energy proportional datacenter communication is indeed possible.\n    \n    You have been asked to create 5 relevant question-answer pairs from this abstract for a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to understand computer architecture text and domain knowledge.

However, as DRAM process technology scales down to smaller dimensions, it becomes more difficult to prevent DRAM cells from electrically interacting with each other. In this paper, we expose the vulnerability of commodity DRAM chips to disturbance errors. By reading from the same address in DRAM, we show that it is possible to corrupt data in nearby addresses. More specifically, activating the same row in DRAM corrupts data in nearby rows. We demonstrate this phenomenon on Intel and AMD systems using a malicious program that generates many DRAM accesses. We induce errors in most DRAM modules (110 out of 129) from three major DRAM manufacturers. From this we conclude that many deployed systems are likely to be at risk. We identify the root cause of disturbance errors as the repeated toggling of a DRAM row's wordline, which stresses inter-cell coupling effects that accelerate charge leakage from nearby rows. We provide an extensive characterization study of disturbance errors and their behavior using an FPGA-based testing platform. Among our key findings, we show that (i) it takes as few as 139K accesses to induce an error and (ii) up to one in every 1.7K cells is susceptible to errors. After examining various potential ways of addressing the problem, we propose a low-overhead solution to prevent the errors",

However, as DRAM process technology scales down to smaller dimensions, it becomes more difficult to prevent DRAM cells from electrically interacting with each other. In this paper, we expose the vulnerability of commodity DRAM chips to disturbance errors. By reading from the same address in DRAM, we show that it is possible to corrupt data in nearby addresses. More specifically, activating the same row in DRAM corrupts data in nearby rows. We demonstrate this phenomenon on Intel and AMD systems using a malicious program that generates many DRAM accesses. We induce errors in most DRAM modules (110 out of 129) from three major DRAM manufacturers. From this we conclude that many deployed systems are likely to be at risk. We identify the root cause of disturbance errors as the repeated toggling of a DRAM row's wordline, which stresses inter-cell coupling effects that accelerate charge leakage from nearby rows. We provide an extensive characterization study of disturbance errors and their behavior using an FPGA-based testing platform. Among our key findings, we show that (i) it takes as few as 139K accesses to induce an error and (ii) up to one in every 1.7K cells is susceptible to errors.

After examining various potential ways of addressing the problem, we propose a low-overhead solution to prevent the errors\n    \n    You have been asked to create 5 relevant question-answer pairs from this abstract for a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to understand computer architecture text and domain knowledge.

A wide range of biologically interesting phenomena, however, occur over time scales on the order of a millisecond--about three orders of magnitude beyond the duration of the longest current MD simulations. In this paper, we describe a massively parallel machine called Anton, which should be capable of executing millisecond-scale classical MD simulations of such biomolecular systems. The machine, which is scheduled for completion by the end of 2008, is based on 512 identical MD-specific ASICs that interact in a tightly coupled manner using a specialized high-speed communication network.

We evaluate the gains from customizations useful to broad classes of algorithms, such as SIMD units, as well as those specific to particular computation, such as customized storage and functional units. The ASIC is 500x more energy efficient than our original four-processor CMP. Broadly applicable optimizations improve performance by 10x and energy by 7x. However, the very low energy costs of actual core ops (100s fJ in 90nm) mean that over 90% of the energy used in these solutions is still \"overhead\". Achieving ASIC-like performance and efficiency requires algorithm-specific optimizations. For each sub-algorithm of H.264, we create a large, specialized functional unit that is capable of executing 100s of operations per instruction. This improves performance and energy by an additional 25x and the final customized CMP matches an ASIC solution's performance within 3x of its energy and within comparable area.\n    \n    You have been asked to create 5 relevant question-answer pairs from this abstract for a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to understand computer architecture text and domain knowledge.

This framework can be deployed in the cloud and exploit the FPGAs-as-a-service paradigm to provide cost-efficient secondary DNA analysis. We propose conceptualizing genomic reads and associated read attributes as a very large relational database and using extended SQL as a domain-specific language to construct queries that form various data manipulation operations. To accelerate such queries, we design a Genesis hardware library which consists of primitive hardware modules that can be composed to construct a dataflow architecture specialized for those queries. As a proof of concept for the Genesis framework, we present the architecture and the hardware implementation of several genomic analysis stages in the secondary analysis pipeline corresponding to the best known software analysis toolkit, GATK4 workflow proposed by the Broad Institute. We walk through the construction of genomic data analysis operations using a sequence of SQL-style queries and show how Genesis hardware library modules can be utilized to construct the hardware pipelines designed to accelerate such queries. We exploit parallelism and data reuse by utilizing a dataflow architecture along with the use of on-chip scratchpads as well as non-blocking APIs to manage the accelerators, allowing concurrent execution of the accelerator and the host. Our accelerated system deployed on the cloud FPGA performs up to 19.3\u00d7 better than GATK4 running on a commodity multi-core Xeon server and obtains up to 15\u00d7 better cost savings. We believe that if a software algorithm can be mapped onto a hardware library to utilize the underlying accelerator(s) using an already-standardized software interface such as SQL, while allowing the efficient mapping of such interface to primitive hardware modules as we have demonstrated here, it will expedite the acceleration of domain specific algorithms and allow the easy adaptation of algorithm changes.",

You are provided with the following abstract from a paper titled, \"Eyeriss: a spatial architecture for  energy-efficient dataflow for convolutional neural networks\":\n    \n    Abstract:  In this paper, we describe our vision to accelerate algorithms in the domain of genomic data analysis by proposing a framework called Genesis (genome analysis) that contains an interface and an implementation of a system that processes genomic data efficiently. This framework can be deployed in the cloud and exploit the FPGAs-as-a-service paradigm to provide cost-efficient secondary DNA analysis. We propose conceptualizing genomic reads and associated read attributes as a very large relational database and using extended SQL as a domain-specific language to construct queries that form various data manipulation operations. To accelerate such queries, we design a Genesis hardware library which consists of primitive hardware modules that can be composed to construct a dataflow architecture specialized for those queries. As a proof of concept for the Genesis framework, we present the architecture and the hardware implementation of several genomic analysis stages in the secondary analysis pipeline corresponding to the best known software analysis toolkit, GATK4 workflow proposed by the Broad Institute. We walk through the construction of genomic data analysis operations using a sequence of SQL-style queries and show how Genesis hardware library modules can be utilized to construct the hardware pipelines designed to accelerate such queries. We exploit parallelism and data reuse by utilizing a dataflow architecture along with the use of on-chip scratchpads as well as non-blocking APIs to manage the accelerators, allowing concurrent execution of the accelerator and the host. Our accelerated system deployed on the cloud FPGA performs up to 19.3\u00d7 better than GATK4 running on a commodity multi-core Xeon server and obtains up to 15\u00d7 better cost savings. We believe that if a software algorithm can be mapped onto a hardware library to utilize the underlying accelerator(s) using an already-standardized software interface such as SQL, while allowing the efficient mapping of such interface to primitive hardware modules as we have demonstrated here, it will expedite the acceleration of domain specific algorithms and allow the easy adaptation of algorithm changes.\n    \n    You have been asked to create 5 relevant question-answer pairs from this abstract for a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to understand computer architecture text and domain knowledge.

Using a decomposition of execution time, we show that for modern processors that employ aggressive memory latency tolerance techniques, wasted cycles due to insufficient bandwidth generally exceed those due to raw memory latencies. Given the importance of maximizing memory bandwidth, we calculate effective pin bandwidth, then estimate optimal effective pin bandwidth. We measure these quantities by determining the amount by which both caches and minimal-traffic caches filter accesses to the lower levels of the memory hierarchy. We see that there is a gap that can exceed two orders of magnitude between the total memory traffic generated by caches and the minimal-traffic caches---implying that the potential exists to increase effective pin bandwidth substantially. We decompose this traffic gap into four factors, and show they contribute quite differently to traffic reduction for different benchmarks. We conclude that, in the short term, pin bandwidth limitations will make more complex on-chip caches cost-effective.

We show that many of the techniques used to tolerate growing memory latencies do so at the expense of increased bandwidth requirements. Using a decomposition of execution time, we show that for modern processors that employ aggressive memory latency tolerance techniques, wasted cycles due to insufficient bandwidth generally exceed those due to raw memory latencies.

We measure these quantities by determining the amount by which both caches and minimal-traffic caches filter accesses to the lower levels of the memory hierarchy.

In this paper, we explore the design space of microprocessors implemented in such printing technologies - these printed microprocessors will be needed for battery-powered applications with requirements of low cost, conformality, and programmability.

Crosspoint-based instruction ROM outperforms a RAM-based design by 5.77x, 16.8x, and 2.42x respectively in terms of power, area, and delay.\n    \n    You have been asked to create 5 relevant question-answer pairs from this abstract for a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to understand computer architecture text and domain knowledge.

For many networks, the network sparsity caused by weight pruning will actually hurt the overall performance despite large reductions in the model size and required multiply-accumulate operations. Also, encoding the sparse format of pruned networks incurs additional storage space overhead.

For high-parallelism hardware (e.g., GPU), node pruning removes redundant nodes, not redundant weights, thereby reducing computation without sacrificing the dense matrix format. For hardware with moderate parallelism (e.g., desktop CPU), SIMD-aware weight pruning and node pruning are synergistically applied together.

You are provided with the following abstract from a paper titled, \"Eyeriss: a spatial architecture for  energy-efficient dataflow for convolutional neural networks\":\n    \n    Abstract:  As the size of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) continues to grow to increase accuracy and solve more complex problems, their energy footprint also scales. Weight pruning reduces DNN model size and the computation by removing redundant weights. However, we implemented weight pruning for several popular networks on a variety of hardware platforms and observed surprising results. For many networks, the network sparsity caused by weight pruning will actually hurt the overall performance despite large reductions in the model size and required multiply-accumulate operations. Also, encoding the sparse format of pruned networks incurs additional storage space overhead. To overcome these challenges, we propose Scalpel that customizes DNN pruning to the underlying hardware by matching the pruned network structure to the data-parallel hardware organization. Scalpel consists of two techniques: SIMD-aware weight pruning and node pruning. For low-parallelism hardware (e.g., microcontroller), SIMD-aware weight pruning maintains weights in aligned fixed-size groups to fully utilize the SIMD units. For high-parallelism hardware (e.g., GPU), node pruning removes redundant nodes, not redundant weights, thereby reducing computation without sacrificing the dense matrix format. For hardware with moderate parallelism (e.g., desktop CPU), SIMD-aware weight pruning and node pruning are synergistically applied together. Across the microcontroller, CPU and GPU, Scalpel achieves mean speedups of 3.54x, 2.61x, and 1.25x while reducing the model sizes by 88%, 82%, and 53%.

You are provided with the following abstract from a paper titled, \"Eyeriss: a spatial architecture for  energy-efficient dataflow for convolutional neural networks\":\n    \n    Abstract:  Power density continues to increase exponentially with each new technology generation, posing a major challenge for thermal management in modern processors. Much past work has examined microarchitectural policies for reducing total chip power, but these techniques alone are insufficient if not aimed at mitigating individual hotspots. The industry's trend has been toward multicore architectures, which provide additional opportunities for dynamic thermal management. This paper explores various thermal management techniques that exploit the distributed nature of multicore processors. We classify these techniques in terms of core throttling policy, whether that policy is applied locally to a core or to the processor as a whole, and process migration policies. We use Turandot and a HotSpot-based thermal simulator to simulate a variety of workloads under thermal duress on a 4-core PowerPCtrade processor. Using benchmarks from the SPEC 2000 suite we characterize workloads in terms of instruction throughput as well as their effective duty cycles. Among a variety of options we find that distributed control-theoretic DVFS alone improves throughput by 2.5times under our test conditions. Our final design involves a PI-based core thermal controller and an outer control loop to decide process migrations. This policy avoids all thermal emergencies and yields an average of 2.6times speedup over the baseline across all workloads\n    \n    You have been asked to create 5 relevant question-answer pairs from this abstract for a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to understand computer architecture text and domain knowledge.

We propose a solution--from circuit to compiler-that enables general-purpose use of limited-precision, analog hardwareto accelerate \"approximable\" code---code that can tolerate imprecise execution. We utilize an algorithmic transformation that automatically converts approximable regions of code from a von Neumann model to an \"analog\" neural model. We outline the challenges of taking an analog approach, including restricted-range value encoding, limited precision in computation, circuit inaccuracies, noise, and constraints on supported topologies. We address these limitations with a combination of circuit techniques, a hardware/software interface, neuralnetwork training techniques, and compiler support. Analog neural acceleration provides whole application speedup of 3.7x and energy savings of 6.3x with quality loss less than 10% for all except one benchmark. These results show that using limited-precision analog circuits for code acceleration, through a neural approach, is both feasible and beneficial over a range of approximation-tolerant, emerging applications including financial analysis, signal processing, robotics, 3D gaming, compression, and image processing",

We propose a solution--from circuit to compiler-that enables general-purpose use of limited-precision, analog hardwareto accelerate \"approximable\" code---code that can tolerate imprecise execution. We utilize an algorithmic transformation that automatically converts approximable regions of code from a von Neumann model to an \"analog\" neural model. We outline the challenges of taking an analog approach, including restricted-range value encoding, limited precision in computation, circuit inaccuracies, noise, and constraints on supported topologies. We address these limitations with a combination of circuit techniques, a hardware/software interface, neuralnetwork training techniques, and compiler support. Analog neural acceleration provides whole application speedup of 3.7x and energy savings of 6.3x with quality loss less than 10% for all except one benchmark.

You must generate 5 questions and they must follow the following templates: \n    #1) \"Does X provide Y benefits over Z?\" \n    #2) \"Is X primarily responsible for Y?\"\n    #3) \u201cIs X a Y?\u201d\n    #4) \"In X process, must Y always occur before Z?\"\n    #5) \"Does increasing X lead to Y?\"\n    \n    The questions should *not* be so tied to the paper's details or implementation but rather broad enough to be a useful benchmark to evaluate an LLMs computer architecture expertise. The question must be able to be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". Ensure diversity when constructing the 5 questions, so that the correct answers to each question are not all \u201cyes\u201d or all \u201cno\u201d. *Ensure diversity when constructing the 5 questions, so that half of the correct answers to each question are \"yes\" and half are \"no\"*.

You are provided with the following abstract from a paper titled, \"Eyeriss: a spatial architecture for  energy-efficient dataflow for convolutional neural networks\":\n    \n    Abstract:  Software cache-based side channel attacks are a serious new class of threats for computers. Unlike physical side channel attacks that mostly target embedded cryptographic devices, cache-based side channel attacks can also undermine general purpose systems. The attacks are easy to perform, effective on most platforms, and do not require special instruments or excessive computation power. In recently demonstrated attacks on software implementations of ciphers like AES and RSA, the full key can be recovered by an unprivileged user program performing simple timing measurements based on cache misses. We first analyze these attacks, identifying cache interference as the root cause of these attacks. We identify two basic mitigation approaches: the partition-based approach eliminates cache interference whereas the randomization-based approach randomizes cache interference so that zero information can be inferred. We present new security-aware cache designs, the Partition-Locked cache (PLcache) and Random Permutation cache (RPcache), analyze and prove their security, and evaluate their performance.

Its peak floating-point performance is 10 teraflops. Dense wavelength division multiplexed optically connected memory modules provide 10 terabyte per second memory bandwidth. A photonic crossbar fully interconnects its 256 low-power multithreaded cores at 20 terabyte per second bandwidth. We have simulated a 1024 thread Corona system running synthetic benchmarks and scaled versions of the SPLASH-2 benchmark suite. We believe that in comparison with an electrically-connected many-core alternative that uses the same on-stack interconnect power, Corona can provide 2 to 6 times more performance on many memory intensive workloads, while simultaneously reducing power.\n    \n    You have been asked to create 5 relevant question-answer pairs from this abstract for a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to understand computer architecture text and domain knowledge.

Fully realizing the potential of acceleration in this domain requires understanding and leveraging algorithmic properties of DNNs. This paper builds upon the algorithmic insight that bitwidth of operations in DNNs can be reduced without compromising their classification accuracy. However, to prevent loss of accuracy, the bitwidth varies significantly across DNNs and it may even be adjusted for each layer individually. Thus, a fixed-bitwidth accelerator would either offer limited benefits to accommodate the worst-case bitwidth requirements, or inevitably lead to a degradation in final accuracy. To alleviate these deficiencies, this work introduces dynamic bit-level fusion/decomposition as a new dimension in the design of DNN accelerators. We explore this dimension by designing Bit Fusion, a bit-flexible accelerator, that constitutes an array of bit-level processing elements that dynamically fuse to match the bitwidth of individual DNN layers. This flexibility in the architecture enables minimizing the computation and the communication at the finest granularity possible with no loss in accuracy. We evaluate the benefits of Bit Fusion using eight real-world feed-forward and recurrent DNNs. The proposed microarchitecture is implemented in Verilog and synthesized in 45 nm technology. Using the synthesis results and cycle accurate simulation, we compare the benefits of Bit Fusion to two state-of-the-art DNN accelerators, Eyeriss and Stripes. In the same area, frequency, and process technology, Bit Fusion offers 3.9x speedup and 5.1x energy savings over Eyeriss. Compared to Stripes, Bit Fusion provides 2.6x speedup and 3.9x energy reduction at 45 nm node when Bit Fusion area and frequency are set to those of Stripes. Scaling to GPU technology node of 16 nm, Bit Fusion almost matches the performance of a 250-Watt Titan Xp, which uses 8-bit vector instructions, while Bit Fusion merely consumes 895 milliwatts of power.",

This flexibility in the architecture enables minimizing the computation and the communication at the finest granularity possible with no loss in accuracy. We evaluate the benefits of Bit Fusion using eight real-world feed-forward and recurrent DNNs. The proposed microarchitecture is implemented in Verilog and synthesized in 45 nm technology. Using the synthesis results and cycle accurate simulation, we compare the benefits of Bit Fusion to two state-of-the-art DNN accelerators, Eyeriss and Stripes. In the same area, frequency, and process technology, Bit Fusion offers 3.9x speedup and 5.1x energy savings over Eyeriss. Compared to Stripes, Bit Fusion provides 2.6x speedup and 3.9x energy reduction at 45 nm node when Bit Fusion area and frequency are set to those of Stripes. Scaling to GPU technology node of 16 nm, Bit Fusion almost matches the performance of a 250-Watt Titan Xp, which uses 8-bit vector instructions, while Bit Fusion merely consumes 895 milliwatts of power.\n    \n    You have been asked to create 5 relevant question-answer pairs from this abstract for a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to understand computer architecture text and domain knowledge. You must generate 5 questions and they must follow the following templates: \n    #1) \"Does X provide Y benefits over Z?\" \n    #2) \"Is X primarily responsible for Y?\"\n    #3) \u201cIs X a Y?\u201d\n    #4) \"In X process, must Y always occur before Z?\"\n    #5) \"Does increasing X lead to Y?\"\n    \n    The questions should *not* be so tied to the paper's details or implementation but rather broad enough to be a useful benchmark to evaluate an LLMs computer architecture expertise. The question must be able to be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\". Ensure diversity when constructing the 5 questions, so that the correct answers to each question are not all \u201cyes\u201d or all \u201cno\u201d. *Ensure diversity when constructing the 5 questions, so that half of the correct answers to each question are \"yes\" and half are \"no\"*.

You are provided with the following abstract from a paper titled, \"Eyeriss: a spatial architecture for  energy-efficient dataflow for convolutional neural networks\":\n    \n    Abstract:  Exploiting model sparsity to reduce ineffectual computation is a commonly used approach to achieve energy efficiency for DNN inference accelerators. However, due to the tightly coupled crossbar structure, exploiting sparsity for ReRAM-based NN accelerator is a less explored area. Existing architectural studies on ReRAM-based NN accelerators assume that an entire crossbar array can be activated in a single cycle. However, due to inference accuracy considerations, matrix-vector computation must be conducted in a smaller granularity in practice, called Operation Unit (OU). An OU-based architecture creates a new opportunity to exploit DNN sparsity. In this paper, we propose the first practical Sparse ReRAM Engine that exploits both weight and activation sparsity. Our evaluation shows that the proposed method is effective in eliminating ineffectual computation, and delivers significant performance improvement and energy savings.\n    \n    You have been asked to create 5 relevant question-answer pairs from this abstract for a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to understand computer architecture text and domain knowledge.

Such attacks can be mitigated by randomizing the location of the lines in the cache. Our recent proposal, CEASER, makes cache randomization practical by accessing the cache using an encrypted address and periodically changing the encryption key. CEASER was analyzed with the state-of-the-art algorithm on forming eviction sets, and the analysis showed that CEASER with a Remap-Rate of 1% is sufficient to tolerate years of attack. In this paper, we present two new attacks that significantly push the state-of-the-art in forming eviction sets. Our first attack reduces the time required to form the eviction set from O(L2) to O(L), where L is the number of lines in the attack. This attack is 35x faster than the best-known attack and requires that the Remap-Rate of CEASER be increased to 35%. Our second attack exploits the replacement policy (we analyze LRU, RRIP, and Random) to form eviction set quickly and requires that the Remap-Rate of CEASER be increased to more than 100%, incurring impractical overheads. To improve the robustness of CEASER against these attacks in a practical manner, we propose Skewed-CEASER (CEASER-S), which divides the cache ways into multiple partitions and maps the cache line to be resident in a different set in each partition. This design significantly improves the robustness of CEASER, as the attacker must form an eviction set that can dislodge the line from multiple possible locations. We show that CEASER-S can tolerate years of attacks while retaining a Remap-Rate of 1%.

CEASER-S incurs negligible slowdown (within 1%) and a storage overhead of less than 100 bytes for the newly added structures.\n    \n    You have been asked to create 5 relevant question-answer pairs from this abstract for a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to understand computer architecture text and domain knowledge. You must generate 5 questions and they must follow the following templates: \n    #1) \"Does X provide Y benefits over Z?\" \n    #2) \"Is X primarily responsible for Y?\"\n    #3) \u201cIs X a Y?\u201d\n    #4) \"In X process, must Y always occur before Z?\"\n    #5) \"Does increasing X lead to Y?\"\n    \n    The questions should *not* be so tied to the paper's details or implementation but rather broad enough to be a useful benchmark to evaluate an LLMs computer architecture expertise. The question must be able to be answered with \"yes\" or \"no\".

State-of-the-art solutions rely exclusively on the hypervisor (VMM) for expensive page hotness tracking and migrations, limiting the benefits from heterogeneity. To address this, we design HeteroOS, a novel application-transparent OS-level solution for managing memory heterogeneity in virtualized system. The HeteroOS design first makes the guest-OSes heterogeneity-aware and then extracts rich OS-level information about applications' memory usage to place data in the 'right' memory avoiding page migrations. When such pro-active placements are not possible, HeteroOS combines the power of the guest-OSes' information about applications with the VMM's hardware control to track for hotness and migrate only performance-critical pages. Finally, HeteroOS also designs an efficient heterogeneous memory sharing across multiple guest-VMs. Evaluation of HeteroOS with memory, storage, and network-intensive datacenter applications shows up to 2x performance improvement compared to the state-of-the-art VMM-exclusive approach.\n    \n    You have been asked to create 5 relevant question-answer pairs from this abstract for a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to understand computer architecture text and domain knowledge.

You are provided with the following abstract from a paper titled, \"Eyeriss: a spatial architecture for  energy-efficient dataflow for convolutional neural networks\":\n    \n    Abstract:  With the shift towards chip multiprocessors (CMPs), exploiting and managing parallelism has become a central problem in computing systems. Many issues of parallelism management boil down to discerning which running threads or processes are critical, or slowest, versus which are non-critical. If one can accurately predict critical threads in a parallel program, then one can respond in a variety of ways. Possibilities include running the critical thread at a faster clock rate, performing load balancing techniques to offload work onto currently non-critical threads, or giving the critical thread more on-chip resources to execute faster. This paper proposes and evaluates simple but effective thread criticality predictors for parallel applications. We show that accurate predictors can be built using counters that are typically already available on-chip. Our predictor, based on memory hierarchy statistics, identifies thread criticality with an average accuracy of 93% across a range of architectures. We also demonstrate two applications of our predictor. First, we show how Intel's Threading Building Blocks (TBB) parallel runtime system can benefit from task stealing techniques that use our criticality predictor to reduce load imbalance. Using criticality prediction to guide TBB's task-stealing decisions improves performance by 13-32% for TBB-based PARSEC benchmarks running on a 32-core CMP. As a second application, criticality prediction guides dynamic energy optimizations in barrier-based applications. By running the predicted critical thread at the full clock rate and frequency-scaling non-critical threads, this approach achieves average energy savings of 15% while negligibly degrading performance for SPLASH-2 and PARSEC benchmarks.\n    \n    You have been asked to create 5 relevant question-answer pairs from this abstract for a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to understand computer architecture text and domain knowledge.

For such applications, the majority of lines traverse from the MRU position to the LRU position without receiving any cache hits, resulting in inefficient use of cache space. Cache performance can be improved if some fraction of the working set is retained in the cache so that at least that fraction of the working set can contribute to cache hits. We show that simple changes to the insertion policy can significantly reduce cache misses for memory-intensive workloads. We propose the LRU Insertion Policy (LIP) which places the incoming line in the LRU position instead of the MRU position. LIP protects the cache from thrashing and results in close to optimal hitrate for applications that have a cyclic reference pattern. We also propose the Bimodal Insertion Policy (BIP) as an enhancement of LIP that adapts to changes in the working set while maintaining the thrashing protection of LIP. We finally propose a Dynamic Insertion Policy (DIP) to choose between BIP and the traditional LRU policy depending on which policy incurs fewer misses. The proposed insertion policies do not require any change to the existing cache structure, are trivial to implement, and have a storage requirement of less than two bytes. We show that DIP reduces the average MPKI of the baseline 1MB 16-way L2 cache by 21%, bridging two-thirds of the gap between LRU and OPT.",

You are provided with the following abstract from a paper titled, \"Eyeriss: a spatial architecture for  energy-efficient dataflow for convolutional neural networks\":\n    \n    Abstract:  The commonly used LRU replacement policy is susceptible to thrashing for memory-intensive workloads that have a working set greater than the available cache size. For such applications, the majority of lines traverse from the MRU position to the LRU position without receiving any cache hits, resulting in inefficient use of cache space. Cache performance can be improved if some fraction of the working set is retained in the cache so that at least that fraction of the working set can contribute to cache hits. We show that simple changes to the insertion policy can significantly reduce cache misses for memory-intensive workloads. We propose the LRU Insertion Policy (LIP) which places the incoming line in the LRU position instead of the MRU position. LIP protects the cache from thrashing and results in close to optimal hitrate for applications that have a cyclic reference pattern. We also propose the Bimodal Insertion Policy (BIP) as an enhancement of LIP that adapts to changes in the working set while maintaining the thrashing protection of LIP. We finally propose a Dynamic Insertion Policy (DIP) to choose between BIP and the traditional LRU policy depending on which policy incurs fewer misses. The proposed insertion policies do not require any change to the existing cache structure, are trivial to implement, and have a storage requirement of less than two bytes. We show that DIP reduces the average MPKI of the baseline 1MB 16-way L2 cache by 21%, bridging two-thirds of the gap between LRU and OPT.\n    \n    You have been asked to create 5 relevant question-answer pairs from this abstract for a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to understand computer architecture text and domain knowledge.

You are provided with the following abstract from a paper titled, \"Eyeriss: a spatial architecture for  energy-efficient dataflow for convolutional neural networks\":\n    \n    Abstract:  GPU architectures are increasingly important in the multi-core era due to their high number of parallel processors. Programming thousands of massively parallel threads is a big challenge for software engineers, but understanding the performance bottlenecks of those parallel programs on GPU architectures to improve application performance is even more difficult. Current approaches rely on programmers to tune their applications by exploiting the design space exhaustively without fully understanding the performance characteristics of their applications. To provide insights into the performance bottlenecks of parallel applications on GPU architectures, we propose a simple analytical model that estimates the execution time of massively parallel programs. The key component of our model is estimating the number of parallel memory requests (we call this the memory warp parallelism) by considering the number of running threads and memory bandwidth. Based on the degree of memory warp parallelism, the model estimates the cost of memory requests, thereby estimating the overall execution time of a program. Comparisons between the outcome of the model and the actual execution time in several GPUs show that the geometric mean of absolute error of our model on micro-benchmarks is 5.4% and on GPU computing applications is 13.3%.

Fine-grain fabrics (e.g. FPGAs) have traditionally suffered from performance and power inefficiencies due to bit-level reconfigurable abstractions. Both fine-grain and coarse-grain architectures (e.g. CGRAs) traditionally require low level programming and suffer from long compilation times. We address both challenges with Plasticine, a new spatially reconfigurable architecture designed to efficiently execute applications composed of parallel patterns. Parallel patterns have emerged from recent research on parallel programming as powerful, high-level abstractions that can elegantly capture data locality, memory access patterns, and parallelism across a wide range of dense and sparse applications. We motivate Plasticine by first observing key application characteristics captured by parallel patterns that are amenable to hardware acceleration, such as hierarchical parallelism, data locality, memory access patterns, and control flow. Based on these observations, we architect Plasticine as a collection of Pattern Compute Units and Pattern Memory Units. Pattern Compute Units are multi-stage pipelines of reconfigurable SIMD functional units that can efficiently execute nested patterns. Data locality is exploited in Pattern Memory Units using banked scratchpad memories and configurable address decoders. Multiple on-chip address generators and scatter-gather engines make efficient use of DRAM bandwidth by supporting a large number of outstanding memory requests, memory coalescing, and burst mode for dense accesses. Plasticine has an area footprint of 113 mm2 in a 28nm process, and consumes a maximum power of 49 W at a 1 GHz clock. Using a cycle-accurate simulator, we demonstrate that Plasticine provides an improvement of up to 76.9x in performance-per-Watt over a conventional FPGA over a wide range of dense and sparse applications.",

Both fine-grain and coarse-grain architectures (e.g. CGRAs) traditionally require low level programming and suffer from long compilation times. We address both challenges with Plasticine, a new spatially reconfigurable architecture designed to efficiently execute applications composed of parallel patterns. Parallel patterns have emerged from recent research on parallel programming as powerful, high-level abstractions that can elegantly capture data locality, memory access patterns, and parallelism across a wide range of dense and sparse applications. We motivate Plasticine by first observing key application characteristics captured by parallel patterns that are amenable to hardware acceleration, such as hierarchical parallelism, data locality, memory access patterns, and control flow. Based on these observations, we architect Plasticine as a collection of Pattern Compute Units and Pattern Memory Units. Pattern Compute Units are multi-stage pipelines of reconfigurable SIMD functional units that can efficiently execute nested patterns. Data locality is exploited in Pattern Memory Units using banked scratchpad memories and configurable address decoders. Multiple on-chip address generators and scatter-gather engines make efficient use of DRAM bandwidth by supporting a large number of outstanding memory requests, memory coalescing, and burst mode for dense accesses. Plasticine has an area footprint of 113 mm2 in a 28nm process, and consumes a maximum power of 49 W at a 1 GHz clock. Using a cycle-accurate simulator, we demonstrate that Plasticine provides an improvement of up to 76.9x in performance-per-Watt over a conventional FPGA over a wide range of dense and sparse applications.\n    \n    You have been asked to create 5 relevant question-answer pairs from this abstract for a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to understand computer architecture text and domain knowledge. You must generate 5 questions and they must follow the following templates: \n    #1) \"Does X provide Y benefits over Z?\" \n    #2) \"Is X primarily responsible for Y?\"\n    #3) \u201cIs X a Y?\u201d\n    #4) \"In X process, must Y always occur before Z?\"\n    #5) \"Does increasing X lead to Y?\"\n    \n    The questions should *not* be so tied to the paper's details or implementation but rather broad enough to be a useful benchmark to evaluate an LLMs computer architecture expertise.

The Markov prefetcher is distinguished by prefetching multiple reference predictions from the memory subsystem, and then prioritizing the delivery of those references to the processor.This design results in a prefetching system that provides good coverage, is accurate and produces timely results that can be effectively used by the processor. In our cycle-level simulations, the Markov Prefetcher reduces the overall execution stalls due to instruction and data memory operations by an average of 54% for various commercial benchmarks while only using two thirds the memory of a demand-fetch cache organization.\n    \n    You have been asked to create 5 relevant question-answer pairs from this abstract for a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their ability to understand computer architecture text and domain knowledge.

The growing demand for computationally expensive, state-of-the-art DNNs, coupled with diminishing performance gains of general-purpose architectures, has fueled an explosion of specialized Neural Processing Units (NPUs). NPUs for interactive services should satisfy two requirements: (1) execution of DNN models with low latency, high throughput, and high efficiency, and (2) flexibility to accommodate evolving state-of-the-art models (e.g., RNNs, CNNs, MLPs) without costly silicon updates. This paper describes the NPU architecture for Project Brainwave, a production-scale system for real-time AI. The Brainwave NPU achieves more than an order of magnitude improvement in latency and throughput over state-of-the-art GPUs on large RNNs at a batch size of 1. The NPU attains this performance using a single-threaded SIMD ISA paired with a distributed microarchitecture capable of dispatching over 7M operations from a single instruction. The spatially distributed microarchitecture, scaled up to 96,000 multiply-accumulate units, is supported by hierarchical instruction decoders and schedulers coupled with thousands of independently addressable high-bandwidth on-chip memories, and can transparently exploit many levels of fine-grain SIMD parallelism. When targeting an FPGA, microarchitectural parameters such as native datapaths and numerical precision can be \"synthesis specialized\" to models at compile time, enabling atypically high FPGA performance competitive with hardened NPUs. When running on an Intel Stratix 10 280 FPGA, the Brainwave NPU achieves performance ranging from ten to over thirty-five teraflops, with no batching, on large, memory-intensive RNNs.",

The growing demand for computationally expensive, state-of-the-art DNNs, coupled with diminishing performance gains of general-purpose architectures, has fueled an explosion of specialized Neural Processing Units (NPUs). NPUs for interactive services should satisfy two requirements: (1) execution of DNN models with low latency, high throughput, and high efficiency, and (2) flexibility to accommodate evolving state-of-the-art models (e.g., RNNs, CNNs, MLPs) without costly silicon updates. This paper describes the NPU architecture for Project Brainwave, a production-scale system for real-time AI. The Brainwave NPU achieves more than an order of magnitude improvement in latency and throughput over state-of-the-art GPUs on large RNNs at a batch size of 1. The NPU attains this performance using a single-threaded SIMD ISA paired with a distributed microarchitecture capable of dispatching over 7M operations from a single instruction. The spatially distributed microarchitecture, scaled up to 96,000 multiply-accumulate units, is supported by hierarchical instruction decoders and schedulers coupled with thousands of independently addressable high-bandwidth on-chip memories, and can transparently exploit many levels of fine-grain SIMD parallelism. When targeting an FPGA, microarchitectural parameters such as native datapaths and numerical precision can be \"synthesis specialized\" to models at compile time, enabling atypically high FPGA performance competitive with hardened NPUs.
